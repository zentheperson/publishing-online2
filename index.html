        <h1>Wet markets in Singapore</h1>

        <p><i>Wet markets in Singapore</i> is a data visualisation project that explores the spatial distribution of wet markets and supermarkets in relation to where people live, to understand the decline in popularity of wet market. 
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> utilises open source data from data.gov.sg and singstat to display the location of wet markets and supermarkets as the two main food retail option, in relation to population density by planning areas to understand the demand and supply of wet markets in relation to residents. 
            <br><br>
            Through the <i>crowdsourced map</i>, users can report the wet markets they go to most often through the ushahidi platform.
